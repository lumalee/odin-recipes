    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Flammkuchen is a traditional dish from the Alsace region of France, 
      also popular in Germany. It is a type of pizza-like flatbread made with a 
      thin crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The 
      crust is usually topped with a layer of crème fraîche, thinly sliced onions, 
      and bacon or ham, and then baked in a hot oven until the crust is golden 
      brown and the toppings are sizzling. The combination of the creamy, tangy 
      crème fraîche with the salty, smoky bacon and sweet onions makes for a 
      deliciously savory and satisfying flavor profile. Flammkuchen is often 
      enjoyed as an appetizer or snack with a glass of wine, but it can also be 
      served as a main course alongside a green salad.
