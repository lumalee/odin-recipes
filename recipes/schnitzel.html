    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Schnitzel is a traditional dish from Austria and Germany, which has now 
      become popular worldwide. It is a thin slice of meat, usually pork, that 
      is breaded and fried until crispy and golden brown. The result is a deliciously 
      crispy and juicy cutlet that is perfect for a satisfying meal. Schnitzel 
      can be served with various accompaniments such as mashed potatoes, french 
      fries, or salad. It can also be served with a wedge of lemon on the side, 
      which is used to give a tangy citrus flavor to the schnitzel.
