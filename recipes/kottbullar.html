    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Köttbullar, also known as Swedish meatballs, are a traditional Swedish 
      dish made with a blend of ground beef and pork that is seasoned with spices 
      like allspice and nutmeg. The meat mixture is then formed into small, 
      bite-sized meatballs and pan-fried until golden brown. These meatballs are 
      served with a rich and creamy gravy made from beef broth and heavy cream. In 
      Sweden, they are typically served with mashed potatoes or lingonberry jam, 
      but they can also be enjoyed with other side dishes like noodles or vegetables. 
      They have become a popular dish worldwide, and are often found in Swedish 
      restaurants and in frozen food sections of grocery stores.
